\plitemsep 0.1in

\bci 

\item Undergraduate
\bci 
\item They may have partial backgrounds on the math (e.g., only vector calculus + linear algebra). Depending on the students' background, the amount of time for math can be adjusted. 

\item Some mathematical parts may need to be provided with some degree of rigorous proofs. 
\eci 

\item Graduate
\bci
\item Graduate students have already taken the basic math courses on linear algebra, vector calculus, probability, optimization, but they don't have almost no background on machine learning.
\item Math parts can be just reviewed by minimizing the proofs, but additional ML problems can be added to the course, so that they can have more exposure to the ML part.

\begin{frame}{File Organization}

\plitemsep 0.1in

\bci 

\item In each chapter, there is a {\tt main.tex} which you can compile.

\item Common files for all chapters
\bci
\item {\tt myhead.tex}: common headers, e.g., including necessary packages
\item {\tt mydefault.tex}: default values of many latex environments
\item {\tt mymacro.tex}: macros related to linear algebra, e.g., matrix, transpose, inverse, etc
\item {\tt mymath.tex}: other misc. math macros
\item {\tt compile.sh}: shell script which compiles and generate the pdfs of all chapters
\item {\tt print.sh}: shell script which generates the pdfs of 2/1, 4/1 printed formats
\eci

\item Just type "./compile.sh" if you want to get all the pdfs\footnote{Please make compile.sh and print.sh executable, if not, by typing {\tt chmod u+x compile.sh}}.

\item Handout

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\item Slide
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[fleqn,aspectratio=169]{beamer}
\end{verbatim}

\item Difference between Handout and Slide? If you want to use the functionality of ``beamer overlay" to add animations to the slides, you need to compile without handout option. Please visit the following url if you are interested.

% \item Using shell scripts: run {\tt make_slide.sh} or {\tt make_handout.sh}

$\mB = \rowvec{\vb_1 & \vb_2 & \vb_3}$
