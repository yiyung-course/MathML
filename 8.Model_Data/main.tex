\item Compute a posteriori distribution (using Bayes' Theorem) and find $\vth$ that maximizes the distribution:
$$
\max_{\vth} \cprob{\vth \mid \vx} = \max_{\vth} \frac{\cprob{\vx \mid \vth}\cprob{\vth}}{\cprob{\vx}}

\item Often build (probabilistic) models that describe the generative process that generates the observed data

\item In probabilistic modeling, the joint distribution $\cprob{\vx,\vth}$ of the observed variables

\begin{frame}{Bayesian Inference}

\plitemsep 0.05in

\bci 

\item Earlier, two ways of estimating the parameter $\vth$: ML and MAP. Essentially, it is solving an optimization problem to get a single best value $\vth^*.$ $\implies$ Prediction through $\cprob{\vx \mid \vth^*}.$

\item Rather than just a likelihood, having the full posterior distribution can be useful. For a data set $\set{X},$ a parameter prior $\cprob{\vth},$ and a likelihood function, the posterior is:
$$
\cprob{\vth \mid \set{X}} = \frac{\cprob{\set{X} \mid \vth} \cprob{\vth}}{\cprob{\set{X}}}, \quad 
\cprob{\set{X}} = \int \cprob{\set{X} \mid \vth} \cprob{\vth} \; \text{d}\vth
$$

\item \question \bluef{Examples of prediction using the posterior distribution?}

\item Bayesian inference requires to solving integration, which is often challenging. In particuluar, a conjugate prior is not chosen, the integration is not analytically tractable.

\item Approximation technqiues: MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo), Laplance approximation, variational inference, expectation propagation

\begin{frame}{Latent-Variable Models (1)}

\plitemsep 0.05in

\item Including latent variables in the model: Contributing to the interpretability of the model

\item Examples: PCA for dimensionality reduction, Gaussian mixture models for density estimation

\item Offers data generation process through parameters: $\cprob{\vx \mid \vth, \vz}$, $\cprob{z}$

\item Marginalization over the latent variables, which allows parameter estimation by ML and MAP (using the prior $\cprob{\vth}$)
$$

$$

\item We can compute a posterior on the latent variables, but marginalizing over both $\vz$ and $\vth$ is hard:
$$
\cprob{\vz \mid \set{X}} = \frac{\cprob{\set{X}\mid \vz} \cprob{\vz}}{\cprob{X}}, \quad 
\cprob{\set{X} \mid \vz} = \int \cprob{\set{X} \mid \vz, \vth} \cprob{\vth} \text{d}\vth
